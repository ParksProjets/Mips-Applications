You can use the following goals to build the project:

- `make dump` –  Compile the sources and dump the generated ELF file.

- `make copy` – Compile the sources and convert the generated ELF file into a
                binary file saved in **MIPSimu** `build` folder.

- `make run` – Same as `make copy` but run **MIPSimu** after.

- `make clean` – Delete generated `.o` and `.elf` files.
